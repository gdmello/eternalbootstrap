				-->
			    <div class="question">1) How do I use the Passion of Jesus App/booklet?</div>
			    <div class="answer" style="display: none;">
			        <p>
			            According to scripture and sacred tradition, the events of the passion happened over a 24 hour period. Hence the steps of the passion have been adapted to fit into a 24 hour timeline. Individuals are invited at each passion event to pause &amp; glance at our Lord and allow the power of the passion to permeate their current situation. App users are prompted/alerted at each passion step, to take the time to prayerfully read through the relevant <u>reflection</u>, make a sincere <u>response</u> and offer up the suggested <u>prayer intentions</u>. App users may also take advantage of the several Catholic prayers &amp; devotions to pray during each passion step.
			        </p>
			        <p>
			        	Booklets also list the suggested time of each passion event, so that believers could at those specific times, follow the recommended <u>prayer</u> by St.Alphonsus de Liguori. They can then pray for the <u>Grace/Fruit</u> for that appropriate step. For ex. If it's 8pm, turn to the passion event &amp; prayer for 8pm; or if it is 10am, you could turn to the passion event & step closest to 10 am.
			        </p>
			    </div>
			    <div class="question">2) Did the passion events actually take place at that specific time?</div>
			    <div class="answer" style="display: none;">
			        <p>
			            The timeline offered is only to serve as a guideline. There is no definitive way of knowing at what time each event occurred. However, we do know that the event did take place over a 24 hour period right from the onset of our Lord's passion until the time of his crucifixion. Our goal is to accompany our Lord during his passion, irrespective of the exactness of the hour or time the event occurred.
			        </p>
			    </div>
			    <div class="question">3) How do I benefit from the Passion prayers?</div>
			    <div class="answer" style="display: none;">
			        <p>
			            A suggested method would be that, at the specified time, as one gets used to the passion timeline, prayerfully immerse yourself into that particular event. Allow yourself to feel &amp; experience what Jesus was going through out of immense love for you. Then slowly read the accompanying prayer identifying with each word. Out of tender love for Jesus &amp; what he suffered make a heartfelt response while firmly resolving to turn from sin &amp; belong to Him completely. Ask Him for grace &amp; strength in your present need. By witnessing that passion event believe that He cares &amp; understands your deepest need and by the merits of His passion, He will carry you through.
			        </p>
			    </div>
			    <div class="question">4) What if I cannot say the Passion prayers for a specified time?</div>
			    <div class="answer" style="display: none;">
			        <p>
			            The passion prayers are recommended by saints as the best way to grow in holiness &amp; virtue. It is understandable that the prayers during midnight to early morning are difficult to adhere to. However, the entire passion could also be completed in an hour overlooking the timeline. The goal is to be able to discipline our hearts &amp; minds to ponder on the passion frequently and grow in holiness.
			        </p>
			    </div>
			    <div class="question">5) My schedule doesn't allow me to follow the suggested 24 hour passion timeline?</div>
			    <div class="answer" style="display: none;">
			        <p>
			            God understands our need to fulfill our basic vocation. However, when you are able to get a few moments, do make the effort to follow the passion events. Even if you're not able to say the recommended prayers, cast a glance at your Lord, ponder the image and let that stay with you. Note: With the 'App' version you can customize the timeline to 8 hours, 1 hour or 30 minutes.In the update App version (Due Lent 2014) there is also a 'manual' option for users to move at their own pace i.e. not time-bound.
