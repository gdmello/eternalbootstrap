				May we too, draw near the body of Jesus, lowered from the cross and held in his Mother's arms. Let us approach then not by walking but by believing, not with physical steps but with the free decision of our heart. In this lifeless body we see ourselves as members of Christ, his limbs, wounded and suffering, yet safe in the loving embrace of our Mother.
Let us also see ourselves as held in her motherly arms, firm yet gentle the very image of our Mother the church
where we become the mystical body of Christ. As we contemplate the figure of the Pieta we learn devotion to the "yes" of love;
we learn surrender and acceptance, trust and practical concern, a tender heart which restores life and awakens joy.
