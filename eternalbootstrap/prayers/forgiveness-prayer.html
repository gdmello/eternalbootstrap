					<p style="color: #ffff00; text-align: center; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">Let us pray…</p><p></p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">The following prayer covers most significant areas<br>
					of forgiveness. Often, such a prayer will bring to<br>
					mind other areas that need forgiveness. Let the Holy<br>
					Spirit move freely and guide your mind to persons or<br>
					groups that you need to forgive.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
					I ask today to forgive EVERYONE in my life.<br>
					I know that You will give me the strength to<br>
					forgive and I thank You that You love me more<br>
					than I love myself and want my happiness more than<br>
					I desire it for myself. Father, I forgive YOU for<br>
					the times death has come into the family, hard times,<br>
					financial difficulties, or what I thought were punishments<br>
					sent by You and people said, “It’s God’s will,” and I<br>
					become bitter and resentful toward You.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Purify my heart and mind today.<br>
					Lord, I forgive MYSELF for my sins, faults and failings,<br>
					for all that is bad in myself or that I think is bad,<br>
					I forgive myself; and I accept Your forgiveness. I further<br>
					forgive MYSELF for taking Your name in vain, not worshipping<br>
					You by attending church, for hurting my parents, getting drunk,<br>
					for sins against purity, bad books, bad movies, fornication,<br>
					adultery, homosexuality. Also, for abortion, stealing, lying,<br>
					defrauding, hurting peoples’ reputation.<br>
					You have forgiven me today, and I forgive myself.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Thank You, Lord,<br>
					for your grace at this moment. I also forgive MYSELF<br>
					for any delvings in superstition, using ouija boards,<br>
					horoscopes, going to séances, using fortune telling or<br>
					wearing lucky charms. I reject all that superstition and<br>
					choose You alone as my Lord and Savior. Fill me with Your Holy Spirit.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Lord, I truly forgive my MOTHER.<br>
					I forgive her for all the times she hurt me, she resented<br>
					me, she was angry with me and for all the times she punished<br>
					me. I forgive her for the times she preferred my brothers and<br>
					sisters to me. I forgive her for the times she told me I was<br>
					dumb, ugly, stupid, the worst of the children or that I cost<br>
					the family a lot of money. For the times she told me I was<br>
					unwanted, an accident, a mistake or not what she expected, I forgive her.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Lord, I truly forgive my FATHER.<br>
					I forgive him for any non-support, any lack of love, affection<br>
					or attention. I forgive him for any lack of time, for not giving<br>
					me his companionship, for his drinking, arguing and fighting with<br>
					my mother or the other children. For his severe punishments, for<br>
					desertion, for being away from home, for divorcing my mother or for<br>
					any running around, I do forgive him.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Lord, I extend forgiveness<br>
					to my SISTERS AND BROTHERS. I forgive those who rejected me,<br>
					lied about me, hated me, resented me, competed for my parents’<br>
					love, those who hurt me, who physically harmed me. For those<br>
					who were too severe on me, punished me or made my life unpleasant<br>
					in any way, I do forgive them.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Lord, I forgive my SPOUSE<br>
					for lack of love, affection, consideration, support, attention,<br>
					communication; for faults, failings, weaknesses and those other<br>
					acts or words that hurt or disturb me.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Jesus, I forgive my CHILDREN<br>
					for their lack of respect, obedience, love, attention, support,<br>
					warmth, understanding; for their bad habits, falling away from the<br>
					church, any bad actions which disturb me.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Lord God, I forgive my IN-LAWS,<br>
					MY MOTHER-IN-LAW, FATHER-IN-LAW, SON/DAUGHTER-IN-LAW AND<br>
					OTHER RELATIVES by marriage, who treat my family with a lack<br>
					of love. For all their words, thoughts, actions or omissions<br>
					which injure and cause pain, I forgive them.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Please help to forgive my RELATIVES,<br>
					my grandmother and grandfather, aunts, uncles, cousins, who<br>
					may have interfered in our family, been possessive of my parents,<br>
					who may have caused confusion or turned one parent against the other.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Jesus, help me to forgive my CO-WORKERS<br>
					who are disagreeable or make life miserable for me. For<br>
					those who push their work off on me, gossip about me, won’t<br>
					cooperate with me, try to take my job, I do forgive them.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">My NEIGHBORS<br>
					need to be forgiven, Lord. For all their noise, letting<br>
					their property run down, not tying up their dogs who run<br>
					through my yard, not taking in their trash barrels, being<br>
					prejudiced and running down the neighborhood, I do forgive them.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">I do forgive my CLERGYMAN,<br>
					my CONGREGATION and my CHURCH for their lack of support,<br>
					affirmation, bad sermons, pettiness, lack of friendliness, not<br>
					providing me or my family with the inspiration we needed, for<br>
					any hurts they have inflicted on me or my family, even in<br>
					the distant past, I forgive them today.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Lord, I forgive all<br>
					those who are of different PERSUASIONS, those of opposite<br>
					political views who have attacked me, ridiculed me, discriminated<br>
					against me, made fun of me, economically hurt me.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">I forgive those<br>
					of different religious DENOMINATIONS AND BELIEFS<br>
					who have harassed me, attacked me, argued with me,<br>
					forced their view on me or my family.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Those who have harmed me<br>
					ETHNICALLY, have discriminated against me, mocked me,<br>
					made jokes about my race or nationality, hurt my family<br>
					physically, emotionally or economically, I do forgive them today.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Lord, I forgive<br>
					all PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE who have hurt me in any way:<br>
					doctors, nurses, lawyers, judges, politicians and civil servants.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">I forgive all service people:<br>
					policemen, firemen, bus drivers, hospital workers and<br>
					especially repairmen who have taken advantage of me in their work.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Lord, I forgive my EMPLOYER<br>
					for not paying me enough money, for not appreciating my work,<br>
					for being unkind and unreasonable with me, for being angry or<br>
					unfriendly, for not promoting me, and for not complimenting me on my work.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Lord, I forgive my SCHOOLTEACHERS<br>
					AND INSTRUCTORS of the past as well as the present. For those<br>
					who punished me, humiliated me, insulted me, treated me unjustly,<br>
					made fun of me, called me dumb or stupid, made me stay after<br>
					school, I truly forgive them today.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Lord, I forgive my FRIENDS<br>
					who have let me down, lost contact with me, do not support me,<br>
					were not available when I needed help, borrowed money and did not<br>
					return it, gossiped about me.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Lord Jesus,<br>
					I especially pray for the grace of forgiveness for the ONE<br>
					PERSON in life who has HURT ME THE MOST.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">I ask to forgive<br>
					anyone who I consider my greatest enemy, the one who is the<br>
					hardest to forgive or the one who I said I will never forgive.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Lord,<br>
					I beg pardon of all these people for the hurt I have inflicted<br>
					on them, especially my mother and father, and my marriage partner.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">I am especially sorry<br>
					for the three greatest hurts I have inflicted on each of these.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Thank You, Jesus,<br>
					that I am being freed of the evil of unforgiveness.<br>
					Let Your Holy Spirit fill me with light and<br>
					let every dark area of my mind be enlightened.<br>
					AMEN.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Forgiveness is an act of the will, not a feeling.<br>
					If we pray for a person, we can be assured that we have<br>
					forgiven that person. To help accept an individual and<br>
					open ourselves to a particular person more, picture<br>
					him with the Lord Jesus and say to the Lord,<br>
					“I love him because You love him. I forgive him because You forgive him.”</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Forgiveness is a life-long obligation.<br>
					Daily we need to forgive those who hurt or injure us.</p>
