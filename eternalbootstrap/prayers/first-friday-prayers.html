				<h5><span style="color: #ffff00;"><strong>The ‘Great Promise’ of the Nine First Fridays of the Month</strong></span></h5>
				<p>The practice of the Nine First Fridays has its origin in the ‘great promise’ made by Jesus to St. Margaret Mary Alacoque. He said to her: “<em><strong>I promise you that my omnipotent love will grant to all those who receive communion on the first Friday of the month, for nine consecutive months, the grace of final repentance, and that they will not die without receiving the holy sacraments.</strong></em>“</p>
				<p>The conditions outlined by Our Lord to obtain these graces are the following:</p>
				<ol>
				<li>Receive Holy Communion on the First Friday of nine consecutive months without interruption.</li>
				<li>Have the intention of honouring the Sacred Heart of Jesus and obtaining final perseverance.</li>
				<li>Offer each Holy Communion as an act of atonement for the offences committed against the Blessed Sacrament.</li>
				</ol>
				<h5><span style="color: #ffff00;"><strong>Novena Prayer for each First Friday of the month.</strong></span></h5>
				<p>(It should be recited after the Communion of reparation of each month)</p>
